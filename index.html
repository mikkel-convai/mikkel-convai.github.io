        <h2>Personal and Professional Profile</h2>
        <p>Optimistic and down to earth guy who wants to work with what he loves. My ambition is to make the world a slightly better place, and my preferred tools are AI and app development. I am curious and always trying to get better at my craft, focusing on fundamentals like testing, design patterns, and CI/CD. A former elite gymnast, I now enjoy CrossFit, where I've developed a growth mindset.</p>
