              A cross-platform app for tracking training sessions in power
              tumbling or gymnastics. Athletes can log equipment usage, track
              session difficulty levels, and visualize progress through weekly
              summaries. Built with Flutter and Supabase, using Clean
              Architecture principles and BLoC for state management.

            <p>
              A medical app for monitoring respiratory health. My job was
              end-to-end AI, consisting of filtering sound, feature extraction,
              creating models and implementing the models. All ML/DL was done
              using Tensorflow, while the models were implemented into their
              Flutter app.

              Duolingo for football tactics. Coaches can create puzzles and
              quizzes for their athletes. It is made with Flutter and Supabase.
              I've made the app from scratch, following design from co-founder.

              A small passion project, making a tool for students to learn more
              efficient, while trying out the newest Langgraph library. It
              utilizes Langgraph together with SQL and Chroma, for profiling
              students and saving study material.

            <h3>One-Click Chatbot</h3>
            <p>
              A prototype for creating new chatbots for a CMS. With one api
              call, a new group of resources is made in Azure, with everything
              needed for a company to get their own chatbot. Made with Azure
              functions, Bicep and prototyped with Streamlit.

            <p>
              A regression model for an energy trading client. By using APIs to
              gather data, the model reliably forecasted energy prices up to
              four hours in advance, enabling the client to make informed,
              real-time decisions in a complex market.

            <h3>AI Konsulenterne</h3>
            <p>
              For this project I worked on putting together multiple different
              chatbots. The chatbot flow was made with Flowise, while setting up
              vector databases in Pinecone and saving documents in Azure. Some
              chatbots was also made with Azures AI Search, but this set of
              tools ended up being overkill.
